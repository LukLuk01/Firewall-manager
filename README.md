## Firewall Monitoring Module

**File:** `firewall_monitor.ps1`

A real-time event monitoring script that continuously scans Windows Event Logs for firewall-related changes and logs them into a structured `.jsonl` file.  
This module is ideal for auditing, incident analysis, or security research related to system configuration changes.

### Key Features

- Requires Administrator privileges (`#Requires -RunAsAdministrator`)
- Detects additions, deletions, and modifications of firewall rules
- Logs all events to `firewall_changes.jsonl`
- Supports adjustable polling interval (default: 5 seconds)
- Handles errors and logs diagnostic information with timestamps

---

### Output Example (`firewall_changes.jsonl`)

```json
